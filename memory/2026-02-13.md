# 2026-02-13 - OpenClaw Setup & User Context

## User Profile
- **Name:** Dre
- **Timezone:** Eastern (US)
- **OS:** Windows (PowerShell)
- **Primary Interface:** Telegram bot (@tea589bot)
- **Vibe Preference:** Direct, sharp, no corporate fluff. Strong opinions over hedging.

## Setup Completed
- Telegram bot live and working (polling mode, no webhooks)
- Konteks skill installed for persistent memory across sessions
- Model fallbacks: haiku (primary) → gpt-4o → claude-opus
- TTS enabled (voice replies via Telegram, ~$0.015 per 1000 chars)
- Dark mode preference stored in Konteks
- Memory-lancedb configured (auto-capture/recall)

## SOUL.md Rewritten
Updated to be more opinionated and conversational:
- No "Great question!" filler
- Strong takes instead of hedging
- Call out bad ideas directly
- "Be the assistant you'd actually want to talk to at 2am"
- Removed corporate language

## In Progress / Notes
- Browser automation problematic (isolated browser fails, Chrome extension relay issues)
- Hue light integration started: Bridge at 192.168.86.68, API key generation tricky (button timing)
- Caught and killed malicious camofox-browser plugin attempt (credential harvesting patterns detected)
- Current version: 2026.2.6-3, update 2026.2.12 available (skipped due to global install permission issues)

## Key Learnings
- Dre is security-conscious and trusted me to kill malicious plugin
- He's technically capable but needs clear, concise instructions
- Voice interaction is important to him
- Browser control less important than initially thought
